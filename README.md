#jQuery.DOMNodeAppear

jQuery.DOMNodeAppear is basically a replacement for the DOMNodeInserted event. DOMNodeInserted is useful for finding and acting upon new nodes in the DOM, but it fires for every single new node. This can get crazy, and has led to mobile browsers crashing in my experience, which makes *me* crazy.
